## About
The **Scratch Archival Project** aims to create a digital archive of projects shared on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), so that everyone's work can be preserved in the event that something happens to the Scratch website. The archive will be available **for free**, **for everyone**, **forever**.
